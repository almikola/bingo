# bingo

Have created the scaffolding of a bingo board using jquery, but think it would make more sense to make it using html (like the daft punk grid (w02d01)).

on('click', rotate to reveal image or change text -> needs to be decided).

need to add download buttons for the pdf

need sophie to create heroku account plus get url
